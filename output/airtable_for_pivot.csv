FDA is also responsible for advancing the public health by helping to speed innovations that make medicines more effective, safer, and more affordable and by helping the public get the accurate, science-based information they need to use medicines and foods to maintain and improve their health. FDA also has responsibility for regulating the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of tobacco products to protect the public health and to reduce tobacco use by minors. Finally, FDA plays a significant role in the Nationâ€:tm:s counterterrorism capability. FDA fulfills this responsibility by ensuring the security of the food supply and by fostering development of medical products to respond to deliberate and naturally emerging public health threats. History The Food and Drug Administration is the oldest comprehensive consumer protection agency in the U. S. federal government. Its origins can be traced back to the appointment of Lewis Caleb Beck in the Patent Office around 1848 to carry out chemical analyses of agricultural products, a function that the newly created Department of Agriculture inherited in 1862. Although it was not known by its present name until 1930, FDAâ€:tm:s modern regulatory functions began with the passage of the 1906 Pure Food and Drugs Act, a law a quarter-century in the making that prohibited interstate commerce in adulterated and misbranded food and drugs. Harvey Washington Wiley, Chief Chemist of the Bureau of Chemistry in the Department of Agriculture, had been the driving force behind this law and headed its enforcement in the early years, providing basic elements of protection that consumers had never known before that time. The FDA and its responsibilities have undergone a metamorphosis since 1906. Similarly, the marketplace itself, the sciences undergirding the products the agency regulates, and the social, cultural, political, and economic changes that have formed the context for these developments, all have witnessed upheavals over the past century. Yet the core public health mission of the agency remains now as it did then.

EFF broke new ground when it was founded in 1990—well before the Internet was on most people's radar—and continues to confront cutting-edge issues defending free speech, privacy, innovation, and consumer rights today. From the beginning, EFF has championed the public interest in every critical battle affecting digital rights. Blending the expertise of lawyers, policy analysts, activists, and technologists, EFF achieves significant victories on behalf of consumers and the general public. EFF fights for freedom primarily in the courts, bringing and defending lawsuits even when that means taking on the US government or large corporations. By mobilizing more than 140,000 concerned citizens through our Action Center, EFF beats back bad legislation. In addition to advising policymakers, EFF educates the press and public. EFF is a donor-funded nonprofit and depends on your support to continue successfully defending your digital rights.

Its financial assets were built over time through the generosity of members of the Allen and Cassel families, including Charles Allen, Jr., Rita Allen Cassel, Milton Cassel and Lucette Cassel. The Rita Allen Foundation Scholars program selected its first class of Scholars in 1976 as one of the first philanthropic fellowship programs of its kind for early-career biomedical scholars. The program grew out of a deep interest in improving human health, guided by input from leaders in biomedical research. With the Scholars program, the Foundation began what would become its defining approach to philanthropy: investing in the earliest stages of big ideas that have the power to be transformative. New resources allowed the Foundation to hire its first chief executive officer, Elizabeth Good Christopherson, and open its first office in 2009. In the years that followed, with the addition of new Board members and a strategic outlook, the Foundation continued to build on the Scholars program while expanding its venture philanthropy work to invest in innovative solutions to strengthen our democracy through civic literacy and engagement. Today, the intersection of science and democratic engagement is a promising new horizon—science requires robust public support to thrive, and it is, in turn, an essential element of solutions across society.",,,Venture Capital,,,,,,,"Financial Services, Professional Services",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"806,644",,1.7,1.8,2.1,2.0,4,"Management, Operations",,"8,071","2,010,143","4,934.17",10.0,,,,,,,,17003.0,USD,17003.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously known as Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg announced the company's rebrand to Meta on October 28, 2021, at the company's annual Connect Conference. Facebook was founded by Mark Zuckerberg in Menlo Park, California in 2004. With millions of more users, [Friendster] attempted to acquire the company for $10 million in mid-2004. Facebook turned down the offer and subsequently received $12.7 million in funding from [Accel Partners] at a valuation of around $100 million. Facebook continued to grow opening up to high school students in September 2005 and adding a photo-sharing feature the next month. The next spring, Facebook received $25 million in funding from [Greylock Partners] and [Meritech Capital] as well as previous investors [Accel Partners] and [Peter Thiel]. The pre-money valuation for this deal was about $525 million. Facebook subsequently opened up to work networks eventually amassing over 20,000 work networks. Finally, in September 2006, Facebook was opened to anyone with an email address. Facebook continued to receive funding most notably in January 2011 receiving $1.5 billion and valuing the company at $50 billion. A year later in February 2012, Facebook announced that it was filing for its long-anticipated initial public offering. The company went public on May 18, 2012 opening in [NASDAQ] with shares trading at $42.05. Facebook announced positive numbers in February 2012 upon filing for its IPO. As of July 2013, over 1.15 billion users have logged into Facebook every month and 669 million users daily. Mobile users now make up half of Facebook’s user base with 819 million monthly active. Facebook is one of the most trafficked sites in the United States. Additionally, Facebook is the top photo-sharing site with 250 million photos uploaded per day. The company has a strategic partnership with AXA Group to develop marketing and commercial collaboration in the digital, social, and mobile sphere. Meta is currently the owner of many applications and services such as Facebook App, Instagram, Whatsapp, Oculus VR, Pagemodo Pagebuilder, [RSS Graffiti], Huddle, and more. Facebook is the world’s largest social network with over 2.9 billion monthly active users.",,7.0,,,,,,,,"Hardware, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Software",5.0,"Andrew McCollum, Chris Hughes, Dustin Moskovitz, Eduardo Saverin, Mark Zuckerberg",10001+,16.0,IPO,2022-08-04,10000000000.0,USD,10000000000.0,Post-IPO Debt,13787117488.0,USD,13787117488.0,Post-IPO Equity,14402817488.0,USD,14402817488.0,24622817488.0,USD,24622817488.0,"PayPal, Microsoft, General Atlantic, Accel, Peter Thiel",11.0,25.0,101.0,Made Acquisitions,,,,,,,,,,,,Public,2012-05-18,,,18400000000.0,USD,18400000000.0,104000000000.0,USD,104000000000.0,META,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/facebook-ipo--8fd30bb3,NASDAQ,2023-07-26,2023-05-24,242.0,115,,-1.2,-3.3,3.5,9.0,"9,883","Engineering, Finance, Human Resources, Information Technology, Legal, Management, Marketing, Medical & Science, Operations, Pro Services, Product, Sales, Support",,"11,516,043,355",3,"12,313,903,023.5",16.0,,,88.0,"6,912",424,Computing; Calculating,Scientific and electric apparatus and instruments,12894749914.0,USD,12894749914.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously known as Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg announced the company's rebrand to Meta on October 28, 2021, at the company's annual Connect Conference. Facebook was founded by Mark Zuckerberg in Menlo Park, California in 2004. With millions of more users, [Friendster] attempted to acquire the company for $10 million in mid-2004. Facebook turned down the offer and subsequently received $12.7 million in funding from [Accel Partners] at a valuation of around $100 million. Facebook continued to grow opening up to high school students in September 2005 and adding a photo-sharing feature the next month. The next spring, Facebook received $25 million in funding from [Greylock Partners] and [Meritech Capital] as well as previous investors [Accel Partners] and [Peter Thiel]. The pre-money valuation for this deal was about $525 million. Facebook subsequently opened up to work networks eventually amassing over 20,000 work networks. Finally, in September 2006, Facebook was opened to anyone with an email address. Facebook continued to receive funding most notably in January 2011 receiving $1.5 billion and valuing the company at $50 billion. A year later in February 2012, Facebook announced that it was filing for its long-anticipated initial public offering. The company went public on May 18, 2012 opening in [NASDAQ] with shares trading at $42.05. Facebook announced positive numbers in February 2012 upon filing for its IPO. As of July 2013, over 1.15 billion users have logged into Facebook every month and 669 million users daily. Mobile users now make up half of Facebook’s user base with 819 million monthly active. Facebook is one of the most trafficked sites in the United States. Additionally, Facebook is the top photo-sharing site with 250 million photos uploaded per day. The company has a strategic partnership with AXA Group to develop marketing and commercial collaboration in the digital, social, and mobile sphere. Meta is currently the owner of many applications and services such as Facebook App, Instagram, Whatsapp, Oculus VR, Pagemodo Pagebuilder, [RSS Graffiti], Huddle, and more.

Previously known as Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg announced the company's rebrand to Meta on October 28, 2021, at the company's annual Connect Conference. Facebook was founded by Mark Zuckerberg in Menlo Park, California in 2004. With millions of more users, [Friendster] attempted to acquire the company for $10 million in mid-2004. Facebook turned down the offer and subsequently received $12.7 million in funding from [Accel Partners] at a valuation of around $100 million. Facebook continued to grow opening up to high school students in September 2005 and adding a photo-sharing feature the next month. The next spring, Facebook received $25 million in funding from [Greylock Partners] and [Meritech Capital] as well as previous investors [Accel Partners] and [Peter Thiel]. The pre-money valuation for this deal was about $525 million. Facebook subsequently opened up to work networks eventually amassing over 20,000 work networks. Finally, in September 2006, Facebook was opened to anyone with an email address. Facebook continued to receive funding most notably in January 2011 receiving $1.5 billion and valuing the company at $50 billion. A year later in February 2012, Facebook announced that it was filing for its long-anticipated initial public offering. The company went public on May 18, 2012 opening in [NASDAQ] with shares trading at $42.05. Facebook announced positive numbers in February 2012 upon filing for its IPO. As of July 2013, over 1.15 billion users have logged into Facebook every month and 669 million users daily. Mobile users now make up half of Facebook’s user base with 819 million monthly active. Facebook is one of the most trafficked sites in the United States. Additionally, Facebook is the top photo-sharing site with 250 million photos uploaded per day. The company has a strategic partnership with AXA Group to develop marketing and commercial collaboration in the digital, social, and mobile sphere. Meta is currently the owner of many applications and services such as Facebook App, Instagram, Whatsapp, Oculus VR, Pagemodo Pagebuilder, [RSS Graffiti], Huddle, and more. Facebook is the world’s largest social network with over 2.9 billion monthly active users.",,7.0,,,,,,,,"Hardware, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Software",5.0,"Andrew McCollum, Chris Hughes, Dustin Moskovitz, Eduardo Saverin, Mark Zuckerberg",10001+,16.0,IPO,2022-08-04,10000000000.0,USD,10000000000.0,Post-IPO Debt,13787117488.0,USD,13787117488.0,Post-IPO Equity,14402817488.0,USD,14402817488.0,24622817488.0,USD,24622817488.0,"PayPal, Microsoft, General Atlantic, Accel, Peter Thiel",11.0,25.0,101.0,Made Acquisitions,,,,,,,,,,,,Public,2012-05-18,,,18400000000.0,USD,18400000000.0,104000000000.0,USD,104000000000.0,META,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/facebook-ipo--8fd30bb3,NASDAQ,2023-07-26,2023-05-24,242.0,115,,-1.2,-3.3,3.5,9.0,"9,883","Engineering, Finance, Human Resources, Information Technology, Legal, Management, Marketing, Medical & Science, Operations, Pro Services, Product, Sales, Support",,"11,516,043,355",3,"12,313,903,023.5",16.0,,,88.0,"6,912",424,Computing; Calculating,Scientific and electric apparatus and instruments,12894749914.0,USD,12894749914.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We want to serve society and make it a better place for all citizens. Our university has always actively promoted ways to firmly embed our education and research in society.  Our mission of Understanding Society is based on the Christian and humanist traditions in which we have our roots. Important basic principles are sustainability and diversity in the context of corporate social responsibility. We are committed to a society based on these values to which we give shape jointly with citizens and social organizations, government and business. Quality comes first. In all our choices, quality comes before quantity. Whether it is research, education, or valorization, it is our ambition to meet the highest international standards in everything. All research is therefore periodically reviewed by (inter)national committees consisting of renowned scholars. Such an external review is conducted every six years. In addition, internal mid-term reviews take place three years later, also in a six-year cycle. The NVAO (Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders) has awarded Tilburg University the Institutional Quality Assurance Label. This label “expresses that the internal quality care and the efforts of an institution for higher education to improve its performance in relation to the quality of its programs has been positively assessed by the accreditation organization”. Tilburg University is home to a vibrant and stimulating quality culture and has a relevant and widely supported vision on educational quality. The NVAO panel expressed its appreciation for the consistency of Tilburg University’s quality policy, for example, in the development of research-based learning at the Tilburg School of Economics and Management.",,,,,,,10001+,,127,,,,1001-5000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"422,974","2,684",-0.4,-0.4,-0.6,1.0,465,"Engineering, Finance, Human Resources, Management, Marketing, Operations, Pro Services, Sales",,"470,684","116,581","599,233.83",68.0,3.0,,36.0,1,0,Medical Or Veterinary Science; Hygiene,,13096.0,USD,13096.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From a student body of 158 during NYU's very first semester, enrollment has grown to more than 50,000 students at... ... three degree-granting campuses in New York City, Abu Dhabi, and Shanghai, and at study away sites in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North and South America. Today, students come from every state in the union and from 133 foreign countries. The faculty, which initially consisted of fourteen professors and lecturers (among them artist and inventor Samuel F. B. Morse), now totals over 4,500 full-time members whose research and teaching encompasses arts and media; business; law; education; health and medicine; humanities and social sciences; science, technology, engineering, and math; public administration; the ancient world; and continuing professional studies. With more than 2,500 courses offered, the University awards more than 25 different degrees. Although overall the University is large, the individuals schools and colleges are small- to moderate-sized units – each with its own traditions, programs, <a href=""https://www.dissertationcorp.co.uk/"">dissertation help</a> and faculty – and there are many communities to be found within the NYU community based on interests, activities, and shared experiences. The center of NYU is its New York City campus in the heart of Greenwich Village. One of the most creative and energetic cities in the world, New York City has attracted generations of artists, entrepreneurs, and intellectuals. NYU, in keeping with its founder’s vision, is “in and of the city”: the University – which has no walls and no gates – is deeply intertwined with New York City, drawing inspiration from its vitality.",Yes,16.0,University Program,,Private (Non-Profit),Four Year University,10001+,Online and On Campus,"2,067","Content and Publishing, Education, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment",4.0,"Albert Gallatin, Jade Kearney, Mir Hwang, Sandy Balkin",501-1000,5.0,,2023-08-08,,,,Grant,,,,,,,,7189416.0,USD,7189416.0,"US Department of Energy, National Telecommunications and Information Administration, Strada Education Network, Patrick J.

It consists of the Chief Justice of the United States and eight Associate Justices who are nominated by the President and confirmed with the advice and consent (majority vote) of the Senate. Once appointed, Justices effectively have life tenure which terminates only upon death, resignation, retirement, and conviction on impeachment. The court meets in Washington, District of Columbia, in the United States Supreme Court building. The Supreme Court is primarily an appellate court, but it has original jurisdiction over a small range of cases. With few exceptions, the life of a U.S. Supreme Court case begins when a lower court case ends since the Supreme Court is primarily a court of appeals. The losing party in a lower court case must request entry onto the court’s calendar. The justices then decide whether to hear the case, the crucial factor being whether the case can shed new light on an issue of constitutional law. The court hears about 100 of the 10,000 cases that compete for a spot on the court’s calendar each year. Once the court agrees to hear the case, lawyers from each side must submit written arguments. Each justice will typically choose a clerk to review the arguments and prepare a memo, outlining the issues the case presents. The lawyers for each side are informed the date of their oral arguments. Shortly before oral arguments, justices review the memos so that they can anticipate each party’s argument and the theories behind their reasoning. Each party receives half an hour for their oral arguments, including questions from the justices. The justices are seated in order of seniority with the Chief Justice seated in the center. Justices often question the lawyers as their arguments proceed.

It consists of the Chief Justice of the United States and eight Associate Justices who are nominated by the President and confirmed with the advice and consent (majority vote) of the Senate. Once appointed, Justices effectively have life tenure which terminates only upon death, resignation, retirement, and conviction on impeachment. The court meets in Washington, District of Columbia, in the United States Supreme Court building. The Supreme Court is primarily an appellate court, but it has original jurisdiction over a small range of cases. With few exceptions, the life of a U.S. Supreme Court case begins when a lower court case ends since the Supreme Court is primarily a court of appeals. The losing party in a lower court case must request entry onto the court’s calendar. The justices then decide whether to hear the case, the crucial factor being whether the case can shed new light on an issue of constitutional law. The court hears about 100 of the 10,000 cases that compete for a spot on the court’s calendar each year. Once the court agrees to hear the case, lawyers from each side must submit written arguments. Each justice will typically choose a clerk to review the arguments and prepare a memo, outlining the issues the case presents. The lawyers for each side are informed the date of their oral arguments. Shortly before oral arguments, justices review the memos so that they can anticipate each party’s argument and the theories behind their reasoning. Each party receives half an hour for their oral arguments, including questions from the justices. The justices are seated in order of seniority with the Chief Justice seated in the center. Justices often question the lawyers as their arguments proceed.

Founded in 1968 to understand the problems facing America’s cities and assess the programs of the War on Poverty, the Urban Institute brings decades of objective analysis and expertise to policy debates — in city halls and state houses, Congress and the White House, and emerging democracies around the world. Today, their research portfolio ranges from the social safety net to health and tax policies; the well-being of families and neighborhoods; and trends in work, earnings, and wealth building. Their scholars have a distinguished track record of turning evidence into solutions. As an organization, the Urban Institute does not take positions on issues.

Previously known as Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg announced the company's rebrand to Meta on October 28, 2021, at the company's annual Connect Conference. Facebook was founded by Mark Zuckerberg in Menlo Park, California in 2004. With millions of more users, [Friendster] attempted to acquire the company for $10 million in mid-2004. Facebook turned down the offer and subsequently received $12.7 million in funding from [Accel Partners] at a valuation of around $100 million. Facebook continued to grow opening up to high school students in September 2005 and adding a photo-sharing feature the next month. The next spring, Facebook received $25 million in funding from [Greylock Partners] and [Meritech Capital] as well as previous investors [Accel Partners] and [Peter Thiel]. The pre-money valuation for this deal was about $525 million. Facebook subsequently opened up to work networks eventually amassing over 20,000 work networks. Finally, in September 2006, Facebook was opened to anyone with an email address. Facebook continued to receive funding most notably in January 2011 receiving $1.5 billion and valuing the company at $50 billion. A year later in February 2012, Facebook announced that it was filing for its long-anticipated initial public offering. The company went public on May 18, 2012 opening in [NASDAQ] with shares trading at $42.05. Facebook announced positive numbers in February 2012 upon filing for its IPO. As of July 2013, over 1.15 billion users have logged into Facebook every month and 669 million users daily. Mobile users now make up half of Facebook’s user base with 819 million monthly active. Facebook is one of the most trafficked sites in the United States. Additionally, Facebook is the top photo-sharing site with 250 million photos uploaded per day. The company has a strategic partnership with AXA Group to develop marketing and commercial collaboration in the digital, social, and mobile sphere. Meta is currently the owner of many applications and services such as Facebook App, Instagram, Whatsapp, Oculus VR, Pagemodo Pagebuilder, [RSS Graffiti], Huddle, and more.

Previously known as Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg announced the company's rebrand to Meta on October 28, 2021, at the company's annual Connect Conference. Facebook was founded by Mark Zuckerberg in Menlo Park, California in 2004. With millions of more users, [Friendster] attempted to acquire the company for $10 million in mid-2004. Facebook turned down the offer and subsequently received $12.7 million in funding from [Accel Partners] at a valuation of around $100 million. Facebook continued to grow opening up to high school students in September 2005 and adding a photo-sharing feature the next month. The next spring, Facebook received $25 million in funding from [Greylock Partners] and [Meritech Capital] as well as previous investors [Accel Partners] and [Peter Thiel]. The pre-money valuation for this deal was about $525 million. Facebook subsequently opened up to work networks eventually amassing over 20,000 work networks. Finally, in September 2006, Facebook was opened to anyone with an email address. Facebook continued to receive funding most notably in January 2011 receiving $1.5 billion and valuing the company at $50 billion. A year later in February 2012, Facebook announced that it was filing for its long-anticipated initial public offering. The company went public on May 18, 2012 opening in [NASDAQ] with shares trading at $42.05. Facebook announced positive numbers in February 2012 upon filing for its IPO. As of July 2013, over 1.15 billion users have logged into Facebook every month and 669 million users daily. Mobile users now make up half of Facebook’s user base with 819 million monthly active. Facebook is one of the most trafficked sites in the United States. Additionally, Facebook is the top photo-sharing site with 250 million photos uploaded per day. The company has a strategic partnership with AXA Group to develop marketing and commercial collaboration in the digital, social, and mobile sphere. Meta is currently the owner of many applications and services such as Facebook App, Instagram, Whatsapp, Oculus VR, Pagemodo Pagebuilder, [RSS Graffiti], Huddle, and more.
